## Game Assets

My space game includes a playership that the user control, enemy ships that are constantly spawning out of an enemy spawner and a starfield background. The player ship is able to shoot at the enemys by using space bar and the laser will do 1 damage to the enemy. The enemy has increased hull strength that allows it to survive 1 shot from the player ship. The playership must hit the enemy twice for it to explode and die. The enemy ship is shooting lasers every second and if the player ship is hit, it will explode and respawn 1 second later. My game also uses audio files for 4 different things. There is a sound when the enemy ship is destroyed. There is a sound when the enemy ship fires a laser. There is a sound when the playership is destroyed. And there is a soudn when the playership fires a laser. 

# Known Bugs

My game does not have any known bugs. I wanted to impliment a speed powerup feature as well, but my code was bugging out so I removed it from the game. 

## Video Solution

Video of the game (https://drive.google.com/file/d/12JElRlhQdRifzk71Pr3XFjGokz82UwJS/view)

When the video is playing, at least on my end, the audio sounded really bad. I don't know why it was like that. If you're able to actually play the game, the audio will sound much better than in the video.

For the audio part of my game, I was searching through google for a very long time to figure out how to implement audio clips. I found this youtube video that helped me out (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pFlnyfRfRc)
